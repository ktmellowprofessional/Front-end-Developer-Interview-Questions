* What's a cool project that you've recently worked on?
  I implemented a UI for building a customizable chat bot FAQ. I got to work closely with design and platform engineering to merge. It was fun being able to change the bot script and seeing my chat conversation change on Facebook messenger. Also, our first client to use it was Mike Tyson and his FAQ is pretty funny. 
* What are some things you like about the developer tools you use?
  BrowserStack - easy to view responsive testing/designs
  Figma / InDesign - allows me to accurately measure web design features and the dist between.
  ngroc - allows me to check things on a local server with any wifi connected device.
* Who inspires you in the front-end community?
  UX and UI designers. I stink at design and have no interest in pursuing it professionally but I enjoy seeing how designers build a defense for and iterate upon their new ideas.
* Do you have any pet projects? What kind?
  My one and only chrome extension for helping people with amblyopia to do affordable eye exercises at home.
